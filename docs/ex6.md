# No. 6 SSH Host Hopping

## Preparation:

First, create two Hetzner servers: Host A and Host B.

- **Host A:**

  - Has a public IP address
  - Uses the same SSH key as Host B
  - Shares a private network with Host B

- **Host B:**
  - Has only a private network IP
  - Uses the same SSH key as Host A  
    Start the SSH agent and load the private key.

## Step 1: Connect to Host A with Agent Forwarding and Jump to Host B

Connect to Host A using:

```tf
ssh -A root@<ip-host-a>
```

The local key is forwarded via the agent, otherwise it wouldnâ€™t be recognized.
Once on Host A, connect to Host B using:

```tf
ssh root@<network-ip-host-b>
```

## Step 2: Close Both Connections

Exit both sessions with:

```tf
exit
```

## Step 3: Try Connecting to Host B Directly from Local

If you try to connect directly from your local machine to Host B, it should fail and return an error.
Host B is **not supposed to be directly accessible**.

## Step 4: Attempt to Connect Back to Host A from Host B

If you connect from Host A to Host B and then try to connect back from Host B to Host A, this should also fail.
Agent forwarding only works one way, so Host B does not have access to your local key.
